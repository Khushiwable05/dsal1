# This code implements a telephone book using two different hashing techniques: linear probing and chaining.
# It defines functions for inserting and searching for names and phone numbers in both methods.
# The output shows the number of probes required to find each name in both methods, demonstrating their efficiency.
# The linear probing method uses a fixed-size array and resolves collisions by finding the next available slot.
# The chaining method uses a list of lists, where each index contains a list of key-value pairs, allowing for multiple entries at the same index.
# The code is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it suitable for educational purposes.
# The data is hardcoded for demonstration purposes, but it can be easily modified to accept user input or read from a file.
# The output section shows the results of searching for each name in both methods, indicating the number of probes required to find each entry.
# The code is designed to be efficient and effective for small datasets, but may not scale well for larger datasets due to the fixed size of the linear probing array.
# The chaining method is more flexible and can handle larger datasets without the need for resizing the array.
# The code can be further improved by adding error handling, input validation, and user-friendly prompts for better usability.
# The code can also be extended to include additional features such as deleting entries, updating phone numbers, and displaying the entire telephone book.
# The code can be further optimized by using more advanced data structures such as balanced trees or hash tables with dynamic resizing to improve performance and scalability.
# The code can also be modified to support more complex data types, such as objects or dictionaries, to store additional information about each entry in the telephone book.
# The code can be further enhanced by implementing a user interface or command-line interface to allow users to interact with the telephone book more easily.
